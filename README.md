# Blackout

Dims your screen after set time of sitting still. Intended for VR sleeping.    

The three states are Awake > Drowsy > Sleep. Drowsy and Sleep both have customizable visual options (HDR Clamp, Hue, Desaturation, Brightness) and the mod can lower your master volume when sleeping.   

There are customizable thresholds for entering and exiting from Drowsy and Sleep, these are based off of your head movement velocity (Normalized on your avatar size). Along with this the mod can watch your player movement, joystick activity, to move to a more wakeful state.    

The mod can watch your controller movement and menu activity to prevent transitioning to a sleepier state.    

Head Movement Vision will temporary brighten your view based on your head moving.   

There are a couple 'debounce' options to prevent an accidental transition from sleeping to awake. 'Delay between Wakeup' makes it so a transition from Sleep>Drowsy and then from Drowsy>Awake must have a certain delay between them. 'Activity Debounce'  means that you must have two valid inputs within a time window before it will move you up a wakeful state.    

Integration with avatar Parameters (BlackoutModDrowsy & BlackoutModSleep) which get set True if in the respective states.
