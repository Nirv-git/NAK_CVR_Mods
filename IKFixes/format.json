  "description": "A few small fixes and configuration options to IK. Major ones are listed below:\n\n**FBT** - Fixes knee tracking, running animation direction, and animation bleeding into IK while calibrating/running. (no more chest tracker wiggle)\n\n**Halfbody** - Fixes footsteps while on a MovementParent, uses root angle offset to prevent feet from only pointing in head direction, and uses an IKPose to fix feet pointing upward.",
