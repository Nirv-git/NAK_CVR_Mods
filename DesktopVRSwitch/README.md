# DesktopVRSwitch
Allows you to switch between Desktop and VR with a keybind.

Press Control + F6 to switch. SteamVR will automatically start if it isn't already running.

## Note:
* This mod will likely cause issues with other mods that are not built for or expect VRMode changes during runtime.
* This mod may not account for every feature or system present in ChilloutVR. To my knowledge though, I have gotten everything.
