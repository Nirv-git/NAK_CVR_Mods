  "description": "This mod occasionally rewinds animation states that have loop enabled.\n\nUnity seems to have a weird quirk where *sometimes* animations with loop cause performance issues after running for a long time.\nYou'll only start to notice this after a few hours to a few days of idling.\n\nIf you don't happen to be AFK for long periods of time, you probably don't need this mod. This issue seems to be primarily caused by one-two frame animation clips meant for toggles with loop needlessly enabled.",
